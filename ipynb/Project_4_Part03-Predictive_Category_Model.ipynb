       "'pca of a multivariate gaussian distribution centered at   with a standard deviation of  in roughly the     direction and of  in the orthogonal direction the vectors shown are the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix scaled by the square root of the corresponding eigenvalue and shifted so their tails are at the mean principal component analysis pca is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components or sometimes principal modes of variation the number of principal components is less than or equal to the smaller of the number of original variables or the number of observations this transformation is defined in such a way that the first principal component has the largest possible variance that is accounts for as much of the variability in the data as possible and each succeeding component in turn has the highest variance possible under the constraint that it is orthogonal to the preceding components the resulting vectors are an uncorrelated orthogonal basis set pca is sensitive to the relative scaling of the original variables pca was invented in  by karl pearson  as an analogue of the principal axis theorem in mechanics it was later independently developed and named by harold hotelling in the s

dynamics pca is mostly used as a tool in exploratory data analysis and for making predictive models it s often used to visualize genetic distance and relatedness between populations pca can be done by eigenvalue decomposition of a data covariance or correlation matrix or singular value decomposition of a data matrix usually after mean centering and normalizing or using z scores the data matrix for each attribute  the results of a pca are usually discussed in terms of component scores sometimes called factor scores the transformed variable values corresponding to a particular data point and loadings the weight by which each standardized original variable should be multiplied to get the component score  pca is the simplest of the true eigenvector based multivariate analyses often its operation can be thought of as revealing the internal structure of the data in a way that best explains the variance in the data if a multivariate dataset is visualised as a set of coordinates in a high dimensional data space  axis per variable pca can supply the user with a lower dimensional picture a projection of this object when viewed from its most informative viewpoint this is done by using only the first few principal components so that the dimensionality of the transformed data is reduced pca is closely related to factor analysis factor analysis typically incorporates more domain specific assumptions about the underlying structure and solves eigenvectors of a slightly different matrix pca is also related to canonical correlation analysis cca cca defines coordinate systems that

external linksintuition edit pca can be thought of as fitting an n dimensional ellipsoid to the data where each axis of the ellipsoid represents a principal component if some axis of the ellipsoid is small then the variance along that axis is also small and by omitting that axis and its corresponding principal component from our representation of the dataset we lose only a commensurately small amount of information to find the axes of the ellipsoid we must first subtract the mean of each variable from the dataset to center the data around the origin then we compute the covariance matrix of the data and calculate the eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors of this covariance matrix then we must normalize each of the orthogonal eigenvectors to become unit vectors once this is done each of the mutually orthogonal unit eigenvectors can be interpreted as an axis of the ellipsoid fitted to the data the proportion of the variance that each eigenvector represents can be calculated by dividing the eigenvalue corresponding to that eigenvector by the sum of all eigenvalues this procedure is sensitive to the scaling of the data and there is no consensus as to how to best scale the data to obtain optimal results details edit pca is mathematically defined as an orthogonal linear transformation that transforms the data to a new coordinate system such that the greatest variance by some projection of the data comes to lie on the first coordinate called the first principal component the second greatest variance on the second coordinate and so on  consider a data matrix x with column wise zero empirical mean the sample mean of each column has been shifted to zero where each of the n rows represents a different repetition of the experiment and each of the p columns gives a particular kind of feature say the results from a particular sensor mathematically the transformation is defined by a set of p dimensional vectors of weights or loadings w k w wp k displaystyle mathbf

successively inherit the maximum possible variance from x with each loading vector w constrained to be a unit vector first component edit in order to maximize variance the first loading vector w  thus

recognised as a rayleigh quotient a standard result for a positive semidefinite matrix such as xtx is that the quotient s maximum possible value is the largest eigenvalue of the matrix which occurs when w is the corresponding eigenvector with w  found the first component of a data vector x i can then be given as a score t i x i w  in the transformed co ordinates or as the corresponding vector in the original variables x i w  w  further components edit the kth component can be found by subtracting the first k  principal components from x x k x s k xw s w s t displaystyle mathbf hat x   k

k mathbf w mathbf w t mathbf w right it turns out that this gives the remaining eigenvectors of xtx with the maximum values for the quantity in brackets given by their corresponding eigenvalues thus the loading vectors are eigenvectors of xtx the kth component of a data vector x i can therefore be given as a score tk i x i w k in the transformed co ordinates or as the corresponding vector in the space of the original variables x i w k w k where w k is the kth eigenvector of xtx the full principal components decomposition of x can therefore be given ast xw displaystyle mathbf t mathbf x mathbf w where w is a p by p matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors of xtx the transpose of w is sometimes called the whitening or sphering transformation covariances edit xtx itself can be recognised as

corresponding to eigenvalues of a symmetric matrix are orthogonal if the eigenvalues are different or can be orthogonalised if the vectors happen to share an equal repeated value the product in the final line is therefore zero there is no sample covariance between different principal components over the dataset another way to characterise the principal components transformation is therefore as the transformation to coordinates which diagonalise the empirical sample covariance matrix in matrix form the empirical covariance matrix for the original variables can be writtenq xtx wλwt

variables which are uncorrelated over the dataset however not all the principal components need to be kept keeping only the first l principal components produced by using only the first l loading

haplotypes calculated from repeat count values for  y chromosomal str markers from  individuals pca has successfully found linear combinations of the different markers that separate out different clusters corresponding to different lines of individuals y chromosomal genetic descent such dimensionality reduction can be a very useful step for visualising and processing high dimensional datasets while still retaining as much of the variance in the dataset as possible for example selecting l  and keeping only the first two principal components finds the two dimensional plane through the high dimensional dataset in which the data is most spread out so if the data contains clusters these too may be most spread out and therefore most visible to be plotted out in a two dimensional diagram whereas if two directions through the data or two of the original variables are chosen at random the clusters may be much less spread apart from each other and may in fact be much more likely to substantially overlay each other making them indistinguishable similarly in regression analysis the larger the number of explanatory variables allowed the greater is the chance of overfitting the model producing conclusions that fail to generalise to other datasets one approach especially when there are strong correlations between different possible explanatory variables is to reduce them to a few principal components and then run the regression against them a method called principal component regression dimensionality reduction may also be appropriate when the variables in a dataset are noisy if each column of the dataset contains independent identically distributed gaussian noise then the columns of t will also contain similarly identically distributed gaussian noise such a distribution is invariant under the effects of the matrix w which can be thought of as a high dimensional rotation of the co ordinate axes however with more of the total variance concentrated in the first few principal components compared to the same noise variance the proportionate effect of the noise is less the first few components achieve a higher signal to noise ratio pca thus can have the effect of concentrating much of the signal into the first few principal components which can usefully be captured by dimensionality reduction while the later principal components may be dominated by noise and so disposed of without great loss singular value decomposition edit the principal components transformation can also be associated with another matrix factorization the singular value decomposition svd of x x uσwt displaystyle mathbf x mathbf u mathbf sigma mathbf w t here  is an n by p rectangular diagonal matrix of positive numbers  k called the singular values of x u is an n by n matrix the columns of which are orthogonal unit vectors of length n called the left singular vectors of x and w is a p by p whose columns are orthogonal unit vectors of length p and called the right singular vectors of x in terms of this factorization the matrix xtx can be writtenxtx wσutuσwt wςwt displaystyle begin aligned mathbf x t mathbf x mathbf w mathbf sigma mathbf u t mathbf u mathbf sigma mathbf w t mathbf w mathbf sigma  mathbf w t end aligned comparison with the eigenvector factorization of xtx establishes that the right singular vectors w of x are equivalent to the eigenvectors of xtx while the singular values  k of  are equal to the square roots of the eigenvalues  k of xtx using the singular value decomposition the score matrix t can be writtent xw uσwtw u displaystyle begin aligned mathbf t mathbf x mathbf w mathbf u mathbf sigma mathbf w t mathbf w mathbf u mathbf sigma end aligned so each column of t is given by one of the left singular vectors of x multiplied by the corresponding singular value this form is also the polar decomposition of t efficient algorithms exist to calculate the svd of x without having to form the matrix xtx so computing the svd is now the standard way to calculate a principal components analysis from a data matrix citation needed unless only a handful of components are required as with the eigen decomposition a truncated n l score matrix tl can be obtained by considering only the first l largest singular values and their singular vectors tl ulσl xwl displaystyle mathbf t   l mathbf u   l mathbf sigma   l mathbf x mathbf w   l the truncation of a matrix m or t using a truncated singular value decomposition in this way produces a truncated matrix that is the nearest possible matrix of rank l to the original matrix in the sense of the difference between the two having the smallest possible frobenius norm a result known as the eckart young theorem  further considerations edit given a set of points in euclidean space the first principal component corresponds to a line that passes through the multidimensional mean and minimizes the sum of squares of the distances of the points from the line the second principal component corresponds to the same concept after all correlation with the first principal component has been subtracted from the points the singular values in  are the square roots of the eigenvalues of the matrix xtx each eigenvalue is proportional to the portion of the variance more correctly of the sum of the squared distances of the points from their multidimensional mean that is correlated with each eigenvector the sum of all the eigenvalues is equal to the sum of the squared distances of the points from their multidimensional mean pca essentially rotates the set of points around their mean in order to align with the principal components this moves as much of the variance as possible using an orthogonal transformation into the first few dimensions the values in the remaining dimensions therefore tend to be small and may be dropped with minimal loss of information see below pca is often used in this manner for dimensionality reduction pca has the distinction of being the optimal orthogonal transformation for keeping the subspace that has largest variance as defined above this advantage however comes at the price of greater computational requirements if compared for example and when applicable to the discrete cosine transform and in particular to the dct ii which is simply known as the dct nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques tend to be more computationally demanding than pca pca is sensitive to the scaling of the variables if we have just two variables and they have the same sample variance and are positively correlated then the pca will entail a rotation by  and the loadings for the two variables with respect to the principal component will be equal but if we multiply all values of the first variable by  then the first principal component will be almost the same as that variable with a small contribution from the other variable whereas the second component will be almost aligned with the second original variable this means that whenever the different variables have different units like temperature and mass pca is a somewhat arbitrary method of analysis different results would be obtained if one used fahrenheit rather than celsius for example note that pearson s original paper was entitled on lines and planes of closest fit to systems of points in space in space implies physical euclidean space where such concerns do not arise one way of making the pca less arbitrary is to use variables scaled so as to have unit variance by standardizing the data and hence use the autocorrelation matrix instead of the autocovariance matrix as a basis for pca however this compresses or expands the fluctuations in all dimensions of the signal space to unit variance mean subtraction a k a mean centering is necessary for performing pca to ensure that the first principal component describes the direction of maximum variance if mean subtraction is not performed the first principal component might instead correspond more or less to the mean of the data a mean of zero is needed for finding a basis that minimizes the mean square error of the approximation of the data  mean centering is unnecessary if performing a principal components analysis on a correlation matrix as the data are already centered after calculating correlations correlations are derived from the cross product of two standard scores z scores or statistical moments hence the name pearson product moment correlation also see the article by kromrey foster johnson  on mean centering in moderated regression much ado about nothing an autoencoder neural network with a linear hidden layer is similar to pca upon convergence the weight vectors of the k neurons in the hidden layer will form a basis for the space spanned by the first k principal components unlike pca this technique will not necessarily produce orthogonal vectors pca is a popular primary technique in pattern recognition it is not however optimized for class separability  however it has been used to quantify the distance between two or more classes by calculating center of mass for each class in principal component space and reporting euclidean distance between center of mass of two or more classes  the linear discriminant analysis is an alternative which is optimized for class separability table of symbols and abbreviations edit symbolmeaningdimensionsindicesx xij

developed  the applicability of pca is limited by certain assumptions  made in its derivation pca and information theory edit dimensionality reduction loses information in general pca based dimensionality reduction tends to minimize that information loss under certain signal and noise models under the assumption thatx s n displaystyle mathbf x mathbf s mathbf n i e that the data vector x displaystyle mathbf x is the sum of the desired information bearing signal s displaystyle mathbf s and a noise signal n displaystyle mathbf n one can show that pca can be optimal for dimensionality reduction from an information theoretic point of view in particular linsker showed that if s displaystyle mathbf s is gaussian and n displaystyle mathbf n is gaussian noise with a covariance matrix proportional to the identity matrix the pca maximizes the mutual information i y s displaystyle i mathbf y mathbf s between the desired information s displaystyle mathbf s and the dimensionality reduced output y wltx displaystyle mathbf y mathbf w   l t mathbf x  if the noise is still gaussian and has a covariance matrix proportional to the identity matrix i e the components of the vector n displaystyle mathbf n are iid but the information bearing signal s displaystyle mathbf s is non gaussian which is a common scenario pca at least minimizes an upper bound on the information loss which is defined as   i x s i y s displaystyle i mathbf x mathbf s i mathbf y mathbf s the optimality of pca is also preserved if the noise n displaystyle mathbf n is iid and at least more gaussian in terms of the kullback leibler divergence than the information bearing signal s displaystyle mathbf s  in general even if the above signal model holds pca loses its information theoretic optimality as soon as the noise n displaystyle mathbf n becomes dependent computing pca using the covariance method edit the following is a detailed description of pca using the covariance method see also here as opposed to the correlation method  but note that it is better to use the singular value decomposition using standard software citation needed the goal is to transform a given data set x of dimension p to an alternative data set y of smaller dimension l equivalently we are seeking to find the matrix y where y is the kosambi karhunen loève transform klt of matrix x y klt x displaystyle mathbf y mathbb klt mathbf x organize the data set edit suppose you have data comprising a set of observations of p variables and you want to reduce the data so that each observation can be described with only l variables l p suppose further that the data are arranged as a set of n data vectors x xn displaystyle mathbf x    ldots mathbf x   n with each xi displaystyle mathbf x   i representing a single grouped observation of the p variables write x xn displaystyle mathbf x    ldots mathbf x   n as row vectors each of which has p columns place the row vectors into a single matrix x of dimensions n p

that if b consists entirely of real numbers which is the case in many applications the conjugate transpose is the same as the regular transpose please note that outer products apply to vectors for tensor cases we should apply tensor products but the covariance matrix in pca is a sum of outer products between its sample vectors indeed it could be represented as b b see the covariance matrix sections on the discussion page for more information the reasoning behind using n  instead of n to calculate the covariance is bessel s correctionfind the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix edit compute the matrix v of eigenvectors which diagonalizes the covariance matrix c v cv d displaystyle mathbf v  mathbf c mathbf v mathbf d where d is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues of c this step will typically involve the use of a computer based algorithm for computing eigenvectors and eigenvalues these algorithms are readily available as sub components of most

derivation of pca using the covariance method edit let x be a d dimensional random vector expressed as column vector without loss of generality assume x has zero mean we want to find displaystyle ast a d d orthonormal transformation matrix p so that px has a diagonal covariance matrix i e px is a random vector with all its distinct components pairwise uncorrelated a quick computation assuming p displaystyle p were unitary yields cov px e px px e px x p p e xx p p cov x p  displaystyle begin aligned operatorname cov px mathbb e px px mathbb e px x p p mathbb e xx p p operatorname cov x p  end aligned hence displaystyle ast holds if and only if cov x displaystyle operatorname cov x were diagonalisable by p displaystyle p this is very constructive as cov x is guaranteed to be a non negative definite matrix and thus is guaranteed to be diagonalisable by some unitary matrix iterative computation edit in practical implementations especially with high dimensional data large p the covariance method is rarely used because it is not efficient one way to compute the first principal component efficiently  is shown in the following pseudo code for a data matrix x with zero mean without ever computing its covariance matrix r a random vector of length pdo c times s  a vector of length p for each row x x displaystyle mathbf x in mathbf x s s x r x displaystyle mathbf s mathbf s mathbf x cdot mathbf r mathbf x r s s displaystyle mathbf r frac mathbf s mathbf s return rthis algorithm is simply an efficient way of calculating xtx r normalizing and placing the result back in r power iteration it avoids the np operations of calculating the covariance matrix r will typically get close to the first principal component of x within a small number of iterations c the magnitude of s will be larger after each iteration convergence can be detected when it increases by an amount too small for the precision of the machine subsequent principal components can be computed by subtracting component r from x see gram schmidt and then repeating this algorithm to find the next principal component however this simple approach is not numerically stable if more than a small number of principal components are required because imprecisions in the calculations will additively affect the estimates of subsequent principal components more advanced methods build on this basic idea as with the closely related lanczos algorithm one way to compute the eigenvalue that corresponds with each principal component is to measure the difference in mean squared distance between the rows and the centroid before and after subtracting out the principal component the eigenvalue that corresponds with the component that was removed is equal to this difference the nipals method edit non linear iterative partial least squares nipals is an algorithm for computing the first few components in a principal component or partial least squares analysis for very high dimensional datasets such as those generated in the omics sciences e g genomics metabolomics it is usually only necessary to compute the first few pcs the non linear iterative partial least squares nipals algorithm calculates t and wt from x the outer product twt can then be subtracted from x leaving the residual matrix e this can be then used to calculate subsequent pcs  this results in a dramatic reduction in computational time since calculation of the covariance matrix is avoided however for large data matrices or matrices that have a high degree of column collinearity nipals suffers from loss of orthogonality due to machine precision limitations accumulated in each iteration step  a gram schmidt gs re orthogonalization algorithm is applied to both the scores and the loadings at each iteration step to eliminate this loss of orthogonality  online sequential estimation edit in an online or streaming situation with data arriving piece by piece rather than being stored in a single batch it is useful to make an estimate of the pca projection that can be updated sequentially this can be done efficiently but requires different algorithms  pca and qualitative variables edit in pca it is common that we want to introduce qualitative variables as supplementary elements for example many quantitative variables have been measured on plants for these plants some qualitative variables are available as for example the species to which the plant belongs these data were subjected to pca for quantitative variables when analyzing the results it is natural to connect the principal components to the qualitative variable species for this the following results are produced identification on the factorial planes of the different species e g using different colors representation on the factorial planes of the centers of gravity of plants belonging to the same species for each center of gravity and each axis p value to judge the significance of the difference between the center of gravity and origin these results are what is called introducing a qualitative variable as supplementary element this procedure is detailed in and husson l pagès  and pagès  few software offer this option in an automatic way this is the case of spad that historically following the work of ludovic lebart was the first to propose this option and the r package factominer applications edit interest rate derivatives portfolios edit principal component analysis can be directly applied to the risk management of interest rate derivatives portfolios  trading multiple swap instruments which are usually a function of   other market quotable swap instruments is sought to be reduced to usually  or  principal components representing the path of interest rates on a macro basis converting risks to be represented as those to factor loadings or multipliers provides assessments and understanding beyond that available to simply collectively viewing risks to individual   buckets neuroscience edit a variant of principal components analysis is used in neuroscience to identify the specific properties of a stimulus that increase a neuron s probability of generating an action potential  this technique is known as spike triggered covariance analysis in a typical application an experimenter presents a white noise process as a stimulus usually either as a sensory input to a test subject or as a current injected directly into the neuron and records a train of action potentials or spikes produced by the neuron as a result presumably certain features of the stimulus make the neuron more likely to spike in order to extract these features the experimenter calculates the covariance matrix of the spike triggered ensemble the set of all stimuli defined and discretized over a finite time window typically on the order of  ms that immediately preceded a spike the eigenvectors of the difference between the spike triggered covariance matrix and the covariance matrix of the prior stimulus ensemble the set of all stimuli defined over the same length time window then indicate the directions in the space of stimuli along which the variance of the spike triggered ensemble differed the most from that of the prior stimulus ensemble specifically the eigenvectors with the largest positive eigenvalues correspond to the directions along which the variance of the spike triggered ensemble showed the largest positive change compared to the variance of the prior since these were the directions in which varying the stimulus led to a spike they are often good approximations of the sought after relevant stimulus features in neuroscience pca is also used to discern the identity of a neuron from the shape of its action potential spike sorting is an important procedure because extracellular recording techniques often pick up signals from more than one neuron in spike sorting one first uses pca to reduce the dimensionality of the space of action potential waveforms and then performs clustering analysis to associate specific action potentials with individual neurons pca as a dimension reduction technique is particularly suited to detect coordinated activities of large neuronal ensembles it has been used in determining collective variables i e order parameters during phase transitions in the brain  relation between pca and k means clustering edit it was asserted in   that the relaxed solution of k means clustering specified by the cluster indicators is given by the principal components and the pca subspace spanned by the principal directions is identical to the cluster centroid subspace however that pca is a useful relaxation of k means clustering was not a new result see for example  and it is straightforward to uncover counterexamples to the statement that the cluster centroid subspace is spanned by the principal directions  relation between pca and factor analysis edit principal component analysis creates variables that are linear combinations of the original variables the new variables have the property that the variables are all orthogonal the principal components can be used to find clusters in a set of data pca is a variance focused approach seeking to reproduce the total variable variance in which components reflect both common and unique variance of the variable pca is generally preferred for purposes of data reduction i e translating variable space into optimal factor space but not when the goal is to detect the latent construct or factors factor analysis is similar to principal component analysis  in that factor analysis also involves linear combinations of variables different from pca factor analysis is a correlation focused approach seeking to reproduce the inter correlations among variables in which the factors represent the common variance of variables excluding unique variance  in terms of the correlation matrix this corresponds with focusing on explaining the off diagonal terms i e shared co variance while pca focuses on explaining the terms that sit on the diagonal however as a side result when trying to reproduce the on diagonal terms pca also tends to fit relatively well the off diagonal correlations  results given by pca and factor analysis are very similar in most situations but this is not always the case and there are some problems where the results are significantly different factor analysis is generally used when the research purpose is detecting data structure i e latent constructs or factors or causal modeling correspondence analysis edit correspondence analysis ca was developed by jean paul benzécri  and is conceptually similar to pca but scales the data which should be non negative so that rows and columns are treated equivalently it is traditionally applied to contingency tables ca decomposes the chi squared statistic associated to this table into orthogonal factors  because ca is a descriptive technique it can be applied to tables for which the chi squared statistic is appropriate or not several variants of ca are available including detrended correspondence analysis and canonical correspondence analysis one special extension is multiple correspondence analysis which may be seen as the counterpart of principal component analysis for categorical data  generalizations edit nonlinear generalizations edit linear pca versus nonlinear principal manifolds  for

the basal breast cancer subtype is visualized more adequately with elmapd and some features of the distribution become better resolved in comparison to pcad principal manifolds are produced by the elastic maps algorithm data are available for public competition  software is available for free non commercial use  most of the modern methods for nonlinear dimensionality reduction find their theoretical and algorithmic roots in pca or k means pearson s original idea was to take a straight line or plane which will be the best fit to a set of data points principal curves and manifolds  give the natural geometric framework for pca generalization and extend the geometric interpretation of pca by explicitly constructing an embedded manifold for data approximation and by encoding using standard geometric projection onto the manifold as it is illustrated by fig see also the elastic map algorithm and principal geodesic analysis another popular generalization is kernel pca which corresponds to pca performed in a reproducing kernel hilbert space associated with a positive definite kernel multilinear generalizations edit in multilinear subspace learning  pca is generalized to multilinear pca mpca that extracts features directly from tensor representations mpca is solved by performing pca in each mode of the tensor iteratively mpca has been applied to face recognition gait recognition etc mpca is further extended to uncorrelated mpca non negative mpca and robust mpca higher order edit n way principal component analysis may be performed with models such as tucker decomposition parafac multiple factor analysis co inertia analysis statis and distatis robustness weighted pca edit while pca finds the mathematically optimal method as in minimizing the squared error it is sensitive to outliers in the data that produce large errors pca tries to avoid it therefore is common practice to remove outliers before computing pca however in some contexts outliers can be difficult to identify for example in data mining algorithms like correlation clustering the assignment of points to clusters and outliers is not known beforehand a recently proposed generalization of pca  based on a weighted pca increases robustness by assigning different weights to data objects based on their estimated relevancy robust pca via decomposition in low rank and sparse matrices edit robust principal component analysis rpca is a modification of the widely used statistical procedure principal component analysis pca which works well with respect to grossly corrupted observations sparse pca edit a particular disadvantage of pca is that the principal components are usually linear combinations of all input variables sparse pca overcomes this disadvantage by finding linear combinations that contain just a few input variables similar techniques edit independent component analysis edit independent component analysis ica is directed to similar problems as principal component analysis but finds additively separable components rather than successive approximations network component analysis edit given a matrix e displaystyle e it tries to decompose it into two matrices such that e ap displaystyle e ap a key difference from techniques such as pca and ica is that some of the entries of a displaystyle a are constrained to be  here p displaystyle p is termed the regulatory layer while in general such a decomposition can have multiple solutions they prove that if the following conditions are satisfied a displaystyle a has full column rankeach column of a displaystyle a must have at least l  displaystyle l  zeroes where l displaystyle l is the number of columns of a displaystyle a or alternatively the number of rows of p displaystyle p the justification for this criterion is that if a node is removed from the regulatory layer along with all the output nodes connected to it the result must still be characterized by a connectivity matrix with full column rank p displaystyle p must have full row rank then the decomposition is unique up to multiplication by a scalar  software source code edit analytica the built in eigendecomp function
